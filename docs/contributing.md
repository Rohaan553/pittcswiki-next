# Contributing to the Pitt CS Wiki

I am currently developing the Wiki with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwindcss.  
  
If you look at the issues page, you will find tasks that need to be done still.  

If you wish to help, fork the repo, make a branch for your changes, and make a pull request where you describe what you added/changed and I will review it. 

**Make sure you are not working on a task that is already assigned please***
