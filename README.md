# The Pitt Computer Science Wiki

I am going to be rewriting the current pitt cs wiki which can be found [here](https://github.com/pittcsc/pittcswiki/tree/master) using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwindcss

I found that the old codebase is flaky and I believe that it would be more readable, maintainable, and efficient for this website to be written in Next.js rather than Gatsby.

## My Plan

Recreate Wiki as is -> Fix bugs/clean up code -> Attempt to move all CSS to tailwind -> Implement Test Suite -> Add documentation -> Done

## Contributing
