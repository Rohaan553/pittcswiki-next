## Resume Checklist
1. Don't use a flashy resume template. We recommend [FlowCV.io](http://flowcv.io/)
   - Keep the colors minimal (White, Black, Dark Blue)
   - No photos
2. Place an expected graduation date.
3. Emphasize the impact you make in your experience, not the responsibilities you had
   - Ex: Instead of "Helped customers shop" say "Generated $x in sales by helping customers with their purchases" 
4. Place the most recent experience at the top.
5. Start each bullet with an [action verb](https://cdn.uconnectlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2016/01/Resume-2.png)
6. Proofread your bullets. 
   - Spelling and grammatical errors are not good looks and avoidable
8. Avoid excessively wordy bullets: conciseness makes the readers’ lives easier.
   - Each bullet should be a sentence
   - If you have multiple sentences on one bullet you should break it up into multiple bullets
9. Avoid acronyms unless it is widely familiar to non-technical readers 
10. Avoid putting content in the extreme top or bottom of the page. 
    - A cheap printer might cut out the extreme top or bottom.
    - leave a ≥1/2 inch margin for safety.
11. Avoid unnecessarily long names. 
    - Analytic Geometry & Calculus -> Calculus. 
    - Introduction to Systems Software -> Systems Software 
    - The extra words generally do not convey enough information to justify the space that the words take up.
12. Make links clickable.
    - Verify LinkedIn/GitHub links, personal/project websites, and email addresses.
  
## LaTeX-specific tidbits
1. Use \LaTeX when referencing LaTeX (for example, in a skills section) in a LaTeX resume.
2. Quotation marks
   - Use `` for a left quote
   - Use ’’ (two single-quotes) for a right quote
   - Wrong: ”using double quotes is incorrect, the left quote will not render correctly”
